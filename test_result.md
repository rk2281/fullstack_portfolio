### ðŸ“‹ Testing Protocol:
**MUST READ and ADHERE to this protocol before invoking any testing agent:**

1. **Backend Testing First**
   - MUST test backend endpoints using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
   - Test all API endpoints: `/api/profile`, `/api/projects`, `/api/technologies`, `/api/contact`
   - Verify CORS configuration and data responses

2. **Frontend Testing Protocol**
   - ONLY test frontend after backend testing is complete
   - MUST ask user permission before frontend testing
   - Test responsive design, dark mode toggle, form submissions
   - Verify all animations and interactions work correctly

3. **Incorporate User Feedback**
   - Address any issues found during testing
   - Make necessary adjustments based on feedback
   - Re-test after making changes

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:
1. Test backend functionality
2. Get user approval for frontend testing
3. Address any issues found
4. Final polish and optimization
